# OpenWar

**This is extremely WIP at the moment -- it will be awhile before the game is playable.**

See [the wiki](https://github.com/seven1m/openwar/wiki) for discussion about the particulars of implementation and game play.

## Local Dev

You'll need Node.js and Redis, then run:

    npm install
    npm install -g coffee-script
    npm install -g supervisor
    supervisor app.coffee
